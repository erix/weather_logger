Simple web service for logging the Oregon Scientific wireless temperature sensor readings.

The app was built on using the following technologies:
* Sinatra
* Backbone.js
* Twitter Bootstrap
* CoffeeScript
* Sass
* Compass

The app is deployed to Heroku.

The reporting device is built on top of Arduino and a cheap 433Mhz RF receiver. The sketch for Arduino is available in my Arduino repository: erix/arduino/weather
